# uk_flag_postscript
The Union Flag of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom)
as a PostScript file

This PostScript file can be converted to a PDF using ghostscript.
I'm pleased to report that it renders exactly like the 
description and image which can be found at this site:

https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/resources/union-flag-approved-designs

It can be viewed directly using macOS Preview app.

The pdfs folder contains PDF built with ghostscript

The pngs folder contains PNGs built with ghostscript.
The number in the filename is the scale factor. A scale
factor of 1 is an image of 50x30 points. If you are feeling
patriotic and want your desktop background to be a Union
Flag, flag64.png is a 3200x1920 points image.

The images were generated with the Bash scripts
flagpdf.sh and flagpng.sh. There should be no
problems running these scripts on macOS and Linux.
